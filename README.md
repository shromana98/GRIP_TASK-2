# GRIP_TASK2

# Tasks completed as a Data Science & Business Analytics Intern at The Sparks Foundation under the #GRIPSEPT23

This repository contains the second  project completed for the The Graduate Rotational Internship Program under The Sparks Foundation.

# Task 2:

Prediction using Unsupervised Machine Learning

# Aim:

From the given 'Iris' dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually

Hello everyone, I am delighted to announce that I have completed the #task3   of the Data Science and Business Analytics Internship at The Sparks Foundation for the GRIP SEPTEMBER 2023 batch.
I am thankful to The Sparks Foundation for giving me this wonderful opportunity.
Thanks in advance for evaluating my work, any suggestions for improvement will be greatly appreciated.

IDE: Jupyter Lab
Programming Language: Python
Objectives:
1)Exploratory analysis of the Iris dataset
2)Finding the optimal number of clusters to distinguish species using the elbow method
3)Implementation of K-means clustering of the data using the optimal number of clusters

ðŸš€Excited to share my latest project as a Data Science and Bussiness Analytics Intern at The Sparks Foundation!

I am thankful to The Sparks Foundation for giving me this wonderful opportunity!

ðŸŽ¯Task 1: Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning.

ðŸ‘‰Aim: To predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours.

ðŸ‘‰Description: The Dataset has been exploratory analysed ðŸ“Š to find the correlation of the marks scored with respect to the number of hours the student had studied.
I have developed an Supervised Machine Learning model using linear regression algorithm to predict students' scores based on their study hours.

The accuracy of the model is 96.78% .
I have also predicted the score of student who studies 9.25 hours per day and the result was found to be 92.38%ðŸ“ˆðŸ“š.

ðŸŽ¥Here is a short video of the project..

IDE: Jupyter Notebook
Programming Language: Python
